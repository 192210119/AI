% Base case: when there's 1 disk, move it from Source to Destination
hanoi(1, Source, Destination, _) :-

% Recursive case: move N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary as helper
hanoi(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    hanoi(N1, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),
